## Introduction
TimeKube is a Kubernetes "Time Machine" that provides developers with an intuitive, user-friendly GUI to easily and securely create backups for your Kubernetes clusters with a few clicks of a button; ensuring the protection of your data, configurations, and files.

Most free and open-source Kubernetes backup and restore tools focus on command-line usage requiring developers to learn the complexities of yet another command-line tool which can have complicated usage patterns and lack of discoverability for core features. Proprietary, commercial solutions exist but are equally complex, promising a large feature set to justify their value which results in a lot of bloat and a high price tag.

TimeKube focuses on the workflow of creating and organizing backups so that the data for your cluster is never lost and can be found and restored by any developer in your team.

## Features
- Back up the state of your Kubernetes clusters securely to a file or on the cloud (AWS S3)
- Organize and view previously saved backups
- Retrieve backup files for restoring your Kubernetes clusters

## Installation
Start by cloning the repo, then run the scripts to install dependencies and start the app:
```bash
# Example installation steps
git clone https://github.com/oslabs-beta/TimeKube.git
cd TimeKube
npm install
npm run dev
```
Next, open up a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3000/
